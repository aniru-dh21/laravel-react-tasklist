# Using React.js with Laravel to Build a Draggable Tasklist App

**Tasklist single-page, full-stack app built with Laravel and React.js (with Vite.js). For the drag & drop functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` is used.**

As a backend framework, Laravel actually offers a tool to help you do this, called [Inertia](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/frontend#inertia). Here's what the docs say about it:

> It bridges the gap between your Laravel application and your modern Vue or React frontend, allowing you to build full-fledged, modern frontends using Vue or React while leveraging Laravel routes and controllers for routing, data hydration and authentication - all within a single code repository.
